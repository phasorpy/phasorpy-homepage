Welcome to the homepage of the PhasorPy project.

PhasorPy is an open-source Python library for the analysis of fluorescence
lifetime and hyperspectral images using the phasor approach.

Documentation
=============

The `PhasorPy documentation <docs/stable>`_ thorougly documents all aspects
of the library, including:

- `Tutorials <docs/stable/tutorials/>`_
- `API reference <docs/stable/api/>`_
- `Release notes <docs/stable/release.html>`_
