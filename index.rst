Welcome to the homepage of the PhasorPy project.

PhasorPy is an open-source Python library for the analysis of fluorescence
lifetime and hyperspectral images using the phasor approach.

Documentation
=============

The `PhasorPy documentation <docs/stable/>`_ thorougly documents all aspects
of the library, including:

- `Tutorials <docs/stable/tutorials/>`_
- `API reference <docs/stable/api/>`_
- `Release notes <docs/stable/release/>`_
- `Contributing guide <docs/stable/contributing/>`_
- `Code of conduct <docs/stable/code_of_conduct/>`_
- `Acknowledgments <docs/stable/acknowledgments/>`_
- `License <docs/stable/license/>`_

Resources
=========

Questions about the usage of the PhasorPy library are answered on the
`issue tracker on GitHub <https://github.com/phasorpy/phasorpy/issues>`_.

The library's source code and documentation are maintained in the
`PhasorPy repository on GitHub <https://github.com/phasorpy/phasorpy>`_.
